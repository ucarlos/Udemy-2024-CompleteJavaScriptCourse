 * Challenge02.js
 * Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:
 * 
 * 1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI.
 *    The message can be either:
 *    "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".
 * 2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the
 *    outputs.
 *
 * Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or
 * "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".
 *
 * Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.
 *
 *
 * 👋 OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture
 * IMPORTANT: The ** operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use
 * exactly this formula: mass / (height * height), and not this one mass / (height ** 2).
