 * Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to
 * convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs
 * in their study.
 *  
 * Your tasks:
 * Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
 * ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
 * 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula:
 *    if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge.
 *    If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
 *    
 * 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old
 *    (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
 * 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs
 *    (you should already know from other challenges how we calculate
 *    averages 😉)
 * 4. Run the function for both test datasets.
 *
 * Test data:
 * §Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
 * §Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
 * GOOD LUCK 😀
